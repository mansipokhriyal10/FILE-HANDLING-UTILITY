Project Summary
File Handling Utility – Java Application

Task Introduction:
During my internship, I was assigned a project called "File Handling Utility", which involved building a Java program that performs essential file operations such as writing, reading, and updating text files. The aim of this task was to give practical experience with Java’s file handling capabilities and to demonstrate how these concepts are applied in real-world software tasks.

The solution I created is a console-based, interactive menu application where users can choose to write new content, read existing data, or modify specific lines in a text file. All file interactions are managed within the Java program, creating a simple yet effective utility for basic text file operations. The file used is called File.txt and resides in the same folder as the Java source file.

Technologies and Tools Utilized
Programming Language

Java

Java APIs and Classes

FileWriter & FileReader: Used to write data to and read data from the file.

BufferedReader & BufferedWriter: Used for more efficient, line-by-line file operations.

Scanner: Captures user input through the console.

ArrayList: Temporarily stores the file’s content during modifications.

Exception Handling

Comprehensive try-catch blocks are used to handle file-related errors, input/output issues, and invalid inputs from users.

Development Environment
The project was coded and executed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

Program Features
This Java utility provides an easy-to-use, command-line menu with the following options:

Write to File
Takes user input and writes it into File.txt.
Every write action replaces the existing content with the new input.

Read from File
Reads each line from File.txt and displays it, allowing users to view the current file content.

Modify File
Shows the existing file data along with line numbers.
Users select a line they wish to update and provide the new text.
The program then rewrites File.txt with the modified content.

Exit
Gracefully exits the program.
